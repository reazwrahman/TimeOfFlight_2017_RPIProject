Time of Flight Sensor configuration, sensor reading and data processing code 
This repository contains my codes written for a project done in 2017 in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The project required data readings from 200 time of flight sensors. 
These readings were mapped in a Matlab graph for human occupancy detection in a smart conference room.
